Tried following Python libraries to get checkbox data into json, csv. But failed to get data from checkboxes.
Only checkbox data was image into pdf other data is into text format.
I think optical mark recognition method will work. But it processes data one by one and from image data.

Python Libraries Tried:
    pdftotext, pdfminer, PyPDF2, tabula, pdttotree
